This report aims to provide some insight into the software
development process of the Opnfv community measuring efficiency
and process of the community based on three metrics: the Review
Efficiency Index (REI), the Time to Merge (TTM). 
REI is measured as the number of closed
changesets out of the new ones in a
given period. TTM is measured as the time since a review is submitted
until this is closed.
